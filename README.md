# Temperature-Converter
task-2
A temperature converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to easily convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

The HTML structure provides input fields for Celsius and Fahrenheit values, with CSS styling for an intuitive and appealing user interface.

JavaScript handles the conversion logic, updating the output in real-time as users input values or make selections.

Users can interact with the converter, entering temperatures in one unit and immediately seeing the equivalent in the other.

This tool simplifies temperature conversions, providing a practical example of how web technologies can enhance everyday tasks.
